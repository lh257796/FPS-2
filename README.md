# FPS-2
<!--


FPS Squared is a unique first-person shooter game designed in Unity that uses the player's frames per second (FPS) to affect damage output. The game will feature power-ups that decrease the graphical usage of assets and debuffs that increase asset usage. As the player progresses through the levels, the game will creatively increase graphical requirements, making it more challenging for the player. The final boss will have animations designed to push the player's system to the limit while providing enough power-ups for a skilled player to still win.
